# Amiami-Bot
Simple Amiami stock checker. Amiami do restocks in the middle of the night while I'm sleeping so I often miss them. I created this bot and deployed to a server instance so it will check if the figure is in stock and once it is, will go through the check out process for me while I sleep.

Of course, this check out process assumes you already have a credit card on file, I may update this another time for the paypal option but for now it works for what I need it to.
